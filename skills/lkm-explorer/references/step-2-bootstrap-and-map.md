# Step 2 — Bootstrap, Refine, Decompose, And Map DSL

Load this file only after Step 1 is complete. This step turns accepted LKM
payload content into Gaia DSL source.

## Required References

- `mapping-contract.md` §§0–2, 5–7 for claim, derive, references, exports,
  and module placement rules.
- `package-skeleton.md` when creating or reshaping package files.

## Bootstrap

For each chain-backed root claim, load the LKM evidence payload. Write:

- one `claim(...)` for the root conclusion,
- one `claim(...)` for every distinct premise with usable content,
- one placeholder `claim(...)` for a chain-internal empty-content premise only
  when needed to preserve a factor-derived `derive(...)`,
- one `derive(conclusion, given=[premises], rationale="<numbered LKM steps>",
  label="<gfac_id>")` for every `gfac_*` factor (the engine `derive(...)`
  has no `metadata=` kwarg; warrant-strength intent lives in the
  `rationale=` prose).

When `factors[].steps[]` contains usable `reasoning`, the deduction rationale
is the full LKM evidence formatted as a numbered markdown list, preserving
step order and figure/table references.

When `factors[].steps[]` is missing or empty, still emit the factor-derived
`derive(...)`, but use an explicit fallback rationale:
`LKM factor <gfac_id> links premises <ids> to conclusion <id>; step-level
reasoning was not returned by the API.`

For an accepted no-chain LKM source claim (`total_chains=0`), write only a
leaf/source `claim(...)` with:

- `provenance_source="lkm_no_chain"`,
- preserved `lkm_id`.

Do not fabricate premises, factors, steps, or `derive(...)` for no-chain
source claims.

## Empty-Content Premises Vs Search Leads

If a premise is inside an accepted chain-backed factor but has an empty
`content`, it may enter Gaia as a placeholder only to preserve that factor's
deduction structure. Use a content string such as
`"<unexpanded LKM premise gcn_xxx>"`, preserve the LKM id, and add
`todo="revisit when LKM corpus populates this premise"`.

If an empty or under-provenanced item came from match/search output outside an
accepted chain-backed factor, classify it as a search lead. Do not emit a
placeholder claim.

## Claim Self-Containment

Every executable claim must be judgeable true/false without reading the LKM
payload. If raw LKM text omits context, rewrite the claim using only context
available in the LKM claim, factor steps/premises, and `data.papers`.

Include the missing scientific scope when available:

- system/material,
- method/model/measurement protocol,
- quantity and value,
- temperature, pressure, field, sample regime, approximation domain, and
  boundary conditions.

Do not add a `prior` kwarg on `claim(...)`; leaf priors are added via
`gaia author register-prior --file priors.py` after
`gaia build check --hole` reports remaining holes.

## Decompose Compound Claims

Decompose only when both sides can be made self-contained and source-grounded.

Detect compound claims such as:

- "method A predicts X, method B measures Y, they disagree",
- "M1 and M2 agree",
- "theory vs experiment differs by N%".

For each side, write an atomic claim with explicit system, method, quantity,
value, and conditions. If the evidence does not support two self-contained
atomic claims, keep the original compound claim and log the limitation.

Connect decomposed claims through `mapping-contract.md` §4:

- Accepted scientific contradiction -> emit direct `contradict(A, B)` with
  an `xx_vs_yy` label and the associated `open_problem:` rationale.
  Warrant-strength intent (clear vs. less crisp) lives in the rationale
  prose; the engine `contradict(...)` has no `metadata=` kwarg.
- Same proposition -> `equal(A, B, rationale="...", label="...")`. The
  engine `equal(...)` likewise has no `metadata=` kwarg.
- Useful but not-yet-promoted tension -> no Gaia operator; register an inquiry
  hypothesis instead (see Step 4).

Preserve the original LKM meta-claim as a `claim(C, ...)` with its `lkm_id`
metadata. When an accepted contradiction represents the meta-claim, follow
the operator rules in `mapping-contract.md` §4. If the result is
hypothesis-only, keep C and register an inquiry hypothesis instead.

## References And Modules

Build `references.json` from the union of `data.papers` across raw evidence and
match/source files. Key records as `<FirstAuthorSurname><Year>`, deduped with
suffixes when needed. Cite via `[@<key>]`.

Place source:

- canonical claims, `gfac_*` deductions, and cross-paper operators
  (`equal` / `contradict` / `exclusive`) in `__init__.py` — the upstream
  Mendel/Galileo two-module pattern,
- leaf-prior `register_prior(...)` records in `priors.py` (scaffolded via
  `gaia pkg add-module --name priors --imports register_prior`).

See `package-skeleton.md` for the canonical layout.

## Step-Completion Gate

Before moving to Step 3:

- All accepted claims are self-contained or explicitly retained as placeholders.
- Chain-backed factors have corresponding `derive(...)` calls.
- Factors without step-level reasoning have explicit fallback rationales.
- Chain-internal empty premises are placeholders only when needed for a factor.
- Search leads outside accepted chains do not enter executable DSL.
- No-chain source claims are leaf/source claims only.
- Compound claims have been decomposed according to `mapping-contract.md` §4 or
  explicitly retained with reason.
- References and module placement decisions are ready.
- Mark Step 2 complete, mark Step 3 in progress, then load
  `step-3-contradictions-and-open-questions.md`.
