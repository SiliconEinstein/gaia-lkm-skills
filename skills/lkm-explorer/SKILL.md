description: Contract-driven LKM exploration in service of populating a Gaia knowledge package per the upstream Gaia spec. Maps LKM evidence/source payloads (raw match/evidence/variables JSON) into Gaia DSL via a progressive five-step workflow with contradiction-driven graph expansion. Modes are `batch` (create a fresh `<name>-gaia/` package) and `refresh` (extend or repair an existing package in place). Generic claim/derive/contradict emission rules and package layout are owned upstream (see upstream `SiliconEinstein/Gaia` docs `docs/for-users/`). Domain-agnostic.

# LKM-Explorer

## Mission

Use LKM as the source of truth to explore evidence and build or update a
standalone Gaia knowledge package. This skill turns raw LKM payloads,
exploration state, and package requirements into executable and iteratively
extensible Gaia DSL through contradiction-driven frontier expansion.

It is not only a one-shot converter. During mapping it may continue focused
LKM-grounded checks for claim-driven supports, open questions, contradictions,
equivalences, provenance, and obligations. Every newly retrieved LKM payload
must be classified through the local mapping contract before it enters
executable DSL.

A Gaia package produced here compiles via `gaia build compile`, propagates beliefs
via `gaia run infer`, and carries LKM provenance into `**metadata` kwargs of every
claim.

> **Contract ownership.** Gaia knowledge-package shape (`<name>-gaia/` layout,
> file templates), `claim` / `derive` / `contradict` body discipline, label
> rules, and module placement are owned upstream by `SiliconEinstein/Gaia` —
> see `docs/for-users/language-reference.md` and
> `docs/for-users/quick-start.md`. This skill adds the LKM-specific
> exploration workflow and the LKM-side `lkm_id` / `provenance_source`
> metadata kwargs on emitted statements.

$lkm-api raw JSON + orchestrator flag files

        v
  $lkm-explorer
  (Gaia package source per the upstream Gaia spec)
```

Routed via [`$orchestrator`](../orchestrator/SKILL.md) when the user asks for
a "Gaia package", "Gaia DSL", "knowledge package", or "formalized into Gaia"
from LKM evidence.

## Output Modes

- **Batch** creates a fresh standalone `<name>-gaia/` package.
- **Refresh** extends an existing standalone package while preserving prior
  emitted statements (`gaia author` pre-write collision check enforces
  append-only at the DSL boundary).

Broad topic discovery, root candidate ranking, user-selection checkpoints, and
claim-driven frontier iteration are organized by the LKM-explorer SOP through
`$orchestrator` and `$lkm-api`. Once a mapping run starts, this skill may
request focused LKM retrievals needed to complete its five-step workflow.

Raw LKM payloads consumed during the run live in the agent's scratch.

## Progressive Workflow

At the start of each `$lkm-explorer` run, create a session todo/checklist with
these five items. Mark only Step 1 as in progress. Do not load later step
documents until the current step is complete.

1. **Inputs, scope, and evidence status** — load
   `references/step-1-inputs-and-scope.md`.
2. **Bootstrap, refine, decompose, and map DSL** — load
   `references/step-2-bootstrap-and-map.md`.
3. **Screen contradictions and open questions** — load
   `references/step-3-contradictions-and-open-questions.md`.
4. **Add supports, priors, obligations, and duplicate controls** — load
   `references/step-4-supports-priors-and-review.md`.
5. **Emit package and hand off to quality gates** — load
   `references/step-5-emit-and-handoff.md`.

After each step, immediately mark that todo complete, mark the next todo in
progress, and only then load the next step document. If quality gates reveal new
obligations, start a new five-step iteration with the new target.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Raw LKM JSON and `data.papers` are the source of truth for science-facing
  claims, factors, steps, provenance, and references.
- Chain-backed claims (`total_chains > 0`) may produce factor-derived
  `derive(...)`; no-chain LKM source claims may enter after cold start only
  as leaf/source `claim(...)` nodes.
- Search leads outside accepted chain-backed factors or accepted post-cold-start
  source claims do not enter executable DSL.
- Claims must be self-contained and preserve `lkm_id` when available.
- No `prior` kwarg on `claim(...)`; leaf priors live in
  `register_prior(...)` calls (see upstream `SiliconEinstein/Gaia`
  `docs/for-users/language-reference.md` for package layout and DSL
  discipline).
- Post-cold-start expansion follows the cold-start root frontier selected by the
  user. For every frontier science claim, the orchestrator runs both support and
  open-question/conflict LKM channels; this skill maps accepted candidates.
- Support handling follows `mapping-contract.md` §3: real Gaia
  `derive(target, given=[premises], rationale=..., label=...)`
  syntax (canonical replacement for the legacy named-strategy
  `support(...)`), LKM-grounded endpoints, no synthetic bridge facts, and
  duplicate/shared-factor controls. The engine `derive(...)` signature
  accepts only `{given, background, rationale, label}` — warrant-strength
  intent lives in `--rationale` prose, not in a metadata kwarg.
- Contradiction handling follows `mapping-contract.md` §4: prioritize open
  questions, then final-scan accepted scientific contradictions into direct
  `contradict(a, b)` operators with `xx_vs_yy` labels; other useful tensions
  remain optional inquiry hypotheses.
- Refresh runs must not silently overwrite previously emitted statements;
  `gaia author`'s pre-write collision check enforces this at the CLI boundary.
- Package-level quality gates are run by the orchestrator/caller after source
  emission.

## Responsibility Boundaries

- The SOP/orchestrator owns turn shape, broad root discovery, user checkpoints,
  sibling-skill routing, and final quality-gate acceptance.
- `$lkm-api` owns endpoint mechanics and raw API contract details.
- Upstream `SiliconEinstein/Gaia` owns the unified Gaia knowledge-package
  shape and generic DSL body discipline (see
  `docs/for-users/language-reference.md` and
  `docs/for-users/quick-start.md`).
- `$lkm-explorer` owns LKM-driven exploration and LKM-specific mapping rules
  (evidence-status vocabulary, no-chain source claims, frontier supports,
  open-question-first contradiction handling).
- Evidence-graph rendering, scholarly prose synthesis, external host
  integration, and final scientific review are separate responsibilities.
