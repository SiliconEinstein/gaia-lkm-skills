name: scholarly-synthesis
description: Write a domain-vocabulary scholarly synthesis centered on one chain-backed quantitative claim about a system or setting (any field — physics, chemistry, materials, biology, ML, climate, astrophysics, etc.). Section structure traces the closure chain from observational / experimental anchors → theoretical or computational inputs → derivation / inversion / fitting → cross-method comparison → open problems. Heavy on equations, units, and named author–year references resolved via a supplied `data.papers` bibliographic metadata block. When source-paper figures or data tables are appropriate to quote, the agent does so on a best-effort basis with `Adapted from <author–year>` attribution; when such material is not recoverable from the input payload, the agent surfaces the missing-material list to the user instead of fabricating. Banned-phrase audit (no system / pipeline vocabulary in main narrative). **Mandatory inputs:** an audited evidence graph (source + rendered raster), an audit table with payload anchors, and the `data.papers` bibliographic metadata. If the graph is not provided, stop and instruct the user to supply one.

# Scholarly Synthesis

> **Status: future work.** This skill currently exposes only an atomic surface — synthesis primitive that turns an audited evidence graph plus bibliographic metadata into a domain-vocabulary scholarly article. Full polish (including discovery-flag integration for cross-method comparison and open-problem narration) is deferred to after the LKM→gaia priority workflow lands. The body below is accurate-for-purpose as a writing primitive; expect substantive refinement later.

## Principle

The synthesis answers exactly one question: **how is this result closed?**

Not "is this system / model / phenomenon X conventional?", not "what is the general theory of the field?" — only: given the observational / experimental anchors and the theoretical / computational inputs, what derivation produces the target result, what assumptions does that derivation hide, what theory–theory or method–method tensions does it surface, and where do open theory–experiment / model–observation gaps remain?

The supplied evidence graph and audit table are **mandatory scaffolding**. The synthesis's subject is the **scientific / scholarly claim itself**, in the field's normal vocabulary — not the graph, not whatever pipeline produced it.

## Mandatory inputs

This skill **requires** the following inputs to be supplied by the caller:

1. **Audited evidence graph** — DOT or Mermaid `flowchart` source plus a rendered raster (PNG / PDF / SVG). The rendered raster is what gets embedded as Figure 1 of the body.
2. **Audit table** — per-edge bridge sentences with payload anchors (premise / factor / step references into the underlying source data).
3. **`data.papers` metadata** — the authoritative paper-id → bibliographic-metadata map; the references list is built from this.

If the **graph is not provided**, stop and instruct the user to supply one (graph + raster + audit table). Do not attempt to write a synthesis from raw source JSON without the audited graph — the graph is what disciplines the synthesis's structure and prevents drift into ungrounded prose.

## Source-paper figures and tables (best-effort)

A literature synthesis benefits from reproducing or adapting figures and data tables from the source papers — that is convention in the field. This skill follows the convention on a **best-effort** basis, bounded by what the supplied source payload actually carries.

**When the source payload describes a figure / table.** When premise `content`, claim content, or `factors[i].steps[j].reasoning` quotes or paraphrases a specific figure caption, table row, or numerical breakdown from a source paper, the synthesis may quote that text verbatim with attribution `Adapted from <author–year>`. The "adapted from" tag is mandatory whenever the wording originates from a paper that is not the user-selected root.

**When the source payload does not carry the figure / table itself.** The supplied payload is propositional content — it does not include rendered figure images, image-format tables, or non-textual artifacts. The skill must **not fabricate** a figure or invented numerical table. Instead, the skill records the gap in a **`missing-material.md`** file in the run folder, one row per gap:

```
| section | citation in synthesis | what was referenced | source paper (DOI) | why not reproduced |
```

`missing-material.md` is surfaced to the user in the final hand-off so the user can manually fetch the figure / table from the DOI for camera-ready preparation.

**Citation discipline for adapted material.** Every "Adapted from" attribution names a paper that already appears in the references list (built from `data.papers`). Do not introduce a new paper in an "Adapted from" line that is not in the references — that bypasses the citation-completeness check.

## Topic-agnosticism

This skill is installed by users across many fields. Domain-specific terms in the produced synthesis come from the supplied source payload (premise / factor / step / claim content) and the user-selected claim, plus bibliographic context from `data.papers` — **not** from the skill text. The closure-chain abstraction generalizes:

- **Computational / first-principles fields** — `(electronic structure / force field / simulation inputs) → (intermediate computed quantities) → (derivation / inversion) → (parameter or predicted observable)`.
- **Experimental / observational fields** — `(measurement protocol + calibration + sample / observation conditions) → (raw signal / dataset) → (analysis / inversion) → (extracted parameter or property)`.
- **ML / AI** — `(architecture + dataset + hyperparameters) → (training and intermediate metrics) → (eval protocol) → (benchmark or scaling result)`.
- **Modeling-driven fields** (climate, astrophysics, epidemiology) — `(forcings / initial conditions + model resolution + parameterizations) → (simulated observables) → (comparison / inversion) → (sensitivity or response parameter)`.

Wherever the section structure below says "theoretical / computational inputs" or "cross-method comparison", read the corresponding noun in your own field.

## Hard style bans (main narrative — title, abstract, body, conclusion, references)

The following are forbidden in the main narrative; allowed only in an explicit "methodology / provenance" appendix.

**English ban list:**

- "evidence graph", "subgraph", "dependency graph", "evidence chain", "chain-internal", "chain-backed"
- "premise", "factor", "claim id", "upstream support", "upstream conclusion", "upstream claim"
- "tier 0 / tier 1 / tier 2" (when referring to graph layers)
- "first layer / second layer" (when referring to graph layers, not physical or model layers)
- "audit table", "audit trail", "retrieval bundle", "retrieval system"
- "LKM", "Large Knowledge Model", "gcn_*", "gfac_*", "paper:<id>", "source package id"
- The graph's own section titles (e.g. "evidence chain and context") — never quoted as a section heading

**Locale-mirrored ban list.** When the synthesis is written in a language other than English, mirror the ban list to that language before running the banned-phrase grep. Canonical mirrors:

- *Simplified Chinese:* `证据图`, `子图`, `依赖图`, `证据链`, `链内`, `链支持`, `前提`, `因子`, `声明 id`, `上游支撑`, `上游结论`, `上游声明`, `第 0 层 / 第 1 层 / 第 2 层` (in graph-tier sense), `审计表` / `核查表`, `审计轨迹`, `检索包`, `检索系统`, `LKM`, `大知识模型`, `gcn_*`, `gfac_*`, `paper:<id>`, `来源包 id`, and the graph's own section titles such as `证据链与上下文`.
- *Other locales:* mirror each English term to the equivalent native term before grepping. Document the locale-specific list once in the synthesis's `notes.md` so future runs in the same locale can re-use it.

**Word allow-list.** The English word "chain" is acceptable in physics / domain phrases such as "closure chain", "reaction chain", "supply chain", "Markov chain" — these refer to the substantive scientific concept, not to the graph data structure. The corresponding allow-list in Chinese: `闭合链`, `推理链`, `反应链`, `供应链`, `马尔可夫链` — explicitly permitted in the main narrative. Same logic for "tier" when it refers to a real-world hierarchy in the domain (e.g. "tier-1 evidence" in clinical research) and not to the graph's tier-0/1/2 vocabulary. Use judgement; the test is whether a domain reader who has never heard of the graph would parse the word in its physical / scholarly sense.

External papers are cited by **author–year**, resolved through the `data.papers` metadata block (`en_title`, `authors`, `publication_date`, `publication_name`, `doi`). System identifiers (`gcn_*`, `gfac_*`, `paper:<id>`) may appear only in the optional provenance appendix.

**The rendered evidence graph itself is exempt from the ban,** because its node labels are domain-language phrases (the graph skill mandates human-readable labels). The graph is **Figure 1 of the body**, with a domain-language caption that does not contain banned phrases (no "evidence graph", no "subgraph", no "证据图", etc. in the caption text — call it "closure-chain map of <topic>" or similar). The audit table, by contrast, still belongs only in the optional provenance appendix or in `notes.md` — it carries chain-payload anchors and would trip the banned-phrase grep if placed in the body.

## Default section structure

Generalizable to any chain-backed quantitative root. Adapt the closure-chain expression in section 1 to the domain.

1. **Title.** Names the system / setting, the quantitative result, and the framing question. Localize to the user's prompt language.

2. **Abstract.** ≤ 250 English-word equivalents. For CJK-language syntheses, the analogous bound is ≈ 350 Chinese / Japanese characters; for other languages, scale by typical word density. Cover: the system / setting, the observational signals or experimental anchors that motivate the question, the theoretical / computational task (the chain to close), the central inversion / fitting result, what it resolves, and what it leaves open. End with keywords.

3. **Figure 1 — the closure-chain map.** Embed the rendered evidence graph immediately after the abstract, **before** Section 1. Caption in domain language. Two well-formed examples:

   - English: *"Figure 1. Closure-chain map of <topic>: how the experimental anchors and the theoretical / computational inputs combine to fix <target quantity>. Edge legend on the figure."*
   - 中文: *「图 1. 〈课题〉闭合链图：实验锚点与理论/计算输入如何共同确定〈目标量〉。边的图例见图内。」*

   Do **not** caption it as "evidence graph" / "subgraph" / "证据图" / etc. — those are banned in the main narrative. Do **not** restate the three edge classes ("chain support", "background", "verification support" / "链式支撑", "背景", "核验支撑") inside the body caption — the rendered graph already carries that legend, and repeating those names in body prose risks tripping the banned-phrase grep. Section 1 references the figure (e.g. *"as summarised in Figure 1"*) when introducing the closure chain.

4. **Section 1 — Introduction: the closure chain.**
   State the problem in domain language. Write the closure chain as an explicit schematic — for example:

   `(theoretical / computational inputs) → (intermediate quantities) → (observables or benchmarks) ↔ (target parameter)`

   In a specific domain, instantiate the schematic with the actual symbols, e.g. for a strong-coupling Eliashberg-style problem `α²F(ω) → λ, ω_log → Tc, Δ(0) ↔ μ*`; for a binding-affinity problem `(force field + sampling protocol) → (free-energy estimator output) → (assay K_d) ↔ (binding pose conformation)`; etc. Explain why the framing question is *not* "is this case conventional / typical" but "given these inputs, does this number close the chain consistently".

5. **Section 2 — Observational / experimental constraints.**
   Quote the anchoring measurements with units and uncertainties. State explicitly which observation disciplines which theoretical / computational input. This is the section that prevents the rest of the synthesis from drifting into pure model-talk.

6. **Section 3 — Theoretical / computational inputs.**
   Method (computational technique, fit family, simulation protocol); what was computed or simulated (intermediate quantities); model prunings (which symmetries assumed, which sub-effects dropped); validity conditions (where the chosen method is expected to be reliable). Quote computed numbers from the calculation / simulation paper(s) by author–year. State which simplifications matter for the rest of the chain.

7. **Section 4 — Inversion / fitting.**
   The equation, optimization, or procedure that fixes the target result. Quote it explicitly. Derive or describe the resulting value. Make a clean separation between *measured* / *computed* / *fitted* / *assumed* — a reader should be able to colour each input by category and see what the conclusion really rests on.

8. **Section 5 — Cross-method or cross-formalism comparison.**
   Where applicable: analytical formulas vs numerical solvers, mean-field vs many-body, perturbative vs non-perturbative, model-A vs model-B, in-distribution vs out-of-distribution, simulation-with-X vs simulation-without-X. Quote the discrepancy with units. Explain its origin (truncation conventions, neglected sub-effects, dataset shifts). When verification edges in the graph **partially disconfirm** the root, narrate that tension explicitly here. For accepted contradictions, describe the direct scientific conflict and the associated discriminating open problem. Cite both sides by author–year.

9. **Section 6 — Open problems and what would discriminate.**
   Assumptions that carry the conclusion (symmetry assumptions, single-channel reductions, harmonic / linearity assumptions, fixed priors, etc.); theory–experiment / model–observation gaps still uncovered; theory–theory or method–method tensions; **specific** experiments / measurements / calculations that would discriminate the surviving alternatives. Avoid generic gestures — name the measurement and the threshold. For each accepted contradiction, state the source claims, why they form an adjudicable conflict, and what open problem would discriminate them. Cite both sides by author–year.

10. **References.** Author–year, fully bibliographic. **Build entries from the supplied `data.papers` metadata block:** `en_title` for English titles (or `zh_title` if the synthesis is Chinese and a Chinese title is preferred); `authors` (split on `|` and reformat); `publication_date`; `publication_name`; `doi`. The references list is part of the **main narrative** for ban-list purposes — no `paper:<id>` strings, no system identifiers, no internal claim ids. Append a short closing line such as: *"For further information about each cited result, refer to the original paper via the DOI listed above."*

11. **Optional methodology / provenance appendix.** The only place where the audit table or system identifiers (`gcn_*`, `gfac_*`, `paper:<id>`) may appear. The rendered graph itself is **not** appendix material — it has been promoted to Figure 1 of the body. Caption any appendix tables plainly: this material summarises how the literature was organised during preparation; it is **not** the scientific content of the synthesis.

## Style

- **Equations numbered.** `(1)`, `(2)`, … with `\eqref{...}` cross-references in LaTeX, or `(eq. 3)` inline in markdown.
- **Units everywhere.** Don't write "8.4 K" once and "8.4" later. Keep units on every numeric quantity that has them.
- **Significant figures.** Preserve from source; do not round unless the source does so.
- **Voice.** Impersonal or "we"; never refer to the agent, the graph, or the retrieval pipeline.
- **Tone.** A domain researcher who has never heard of the underlying knowledge-base / retrieval system should be able to read the article cover to cover without losing the argument.

## LaTeX defaults

If LaTeX is requested:

- `article` class, 11–12 pt, A4 or letter.
- For Chinese: `xeCJK` package, e.g. `Noto Serif CJK SC`. For other non-Latin scripts: select an analogous fallback font.
- `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `mathtools` for equations; `hyperref` for cross-refs; `graphicx` for figures. Field-specific packages (e.g. `physics`, `chemfig`, `siunitx`) only when the domain calls for them.
- Compile with `latexmk -xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode` (or `pdflatex` if no CJK).
- Inspect the log for missing-glyph warnings, overfull hboxes, undefined references — fix before declaring done.

## Verification before hand-off

Before declaring the synthesis complete:

1. **Mandatory-inputs check.** Confirm graph (source + rendered raster) + audit table + `data.papers` were all supplied. If any is missing, STOP and request it.
2. **Figure 1 placement.** The rendered evidence graph appears as Figure 1 of the body, immediately after the abstract and before Section 1. Caption is in domain language and contains zero banned phrases.
3. **Banned-phrase grep.** Run a regex grep for the ban list (English + locale mirror) against the main-narrative source (excluding the appendix and the embedded graph file itself, which is binary). Zero hits required. The allow-list above clarifies legitimate uses of words like "chain" / "tier" in the domain sense.
4. **Best-effort numerical-anchor check.** For every number in the synthesis, try to locate it in the supplied source payload (premise `content`, factor steps, claim content) or — for numbers attributed to a different paper — in that paper's `data.papers` entry plus the source payload of the root. The check is **soft**: payloads are sometimes incomplete, and a number may legitimately not be locatable inside the JSON we have. When a number cannot be confirmed, do not delete it — note `anchor not locatable in payload` next to the audit-table row that supplied it. A number that the payload **contradicts**, however, is a source-consistency error and must be fixed; this is separate from Gaia package contradiction admission.
5. **Citation completeness.** Every author–year mention in the body has a matching reference entry built from `data.papers`, and vice versa. Every "Adapted from <author–year>" attribution names a paper already in the references list.
6. **Missing-material list.** `missing-material.md` is up-to-date: every "Adapted from" reference whose figure / table could not be reproduced has a row pointing to the source paper's DOI.
7. **Equation-number consistency.** No undefined `\eqref{...}`, no duplicated labels.

## What this skill is NOT

- Not a broad literature-survey writer. This skill writes one closure-chain article at a time, anchored on a single chain-backed root.
- Not a graph-renderer. The audited graph and rendered raster are caller-supplied inputs; this skill embeds the raster as Figure 1 and consumes the audit table for verification.
- Not a figure-generator. Figures and data tables adapted from source papers may be quoted with attribution when the supplied payload carries the text; image-format figures cannot be reproduced and are surfaced as missing-material gaps for the user to fill in.
- Not for purely qualitative claims. A claim with no numeric or formula-level anchor has no closure step to write about; this skill does not apply.
